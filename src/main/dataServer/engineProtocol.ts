// ============================================================================
//
// The `presenceProtocol.ts` / `presence.ts` split, applied to the data server's supervisor:
// everything in this file is a function of its arguments — the announce line's grammar, the
// restart schedule, the exit-trail fold, the binary-path probe order. No `node:child_process`, no
// `node:net`, no Electron, no clock. That is what lets the whole supervision POLICY be a
// `node:test` unit that never skips, and it is the same seam `processPriority.ts` describes: the
// arithmetic is a MECHANISM, the wiring is a POLICY, and the composition root owns both halves.
//
// THE SPAWN CONTRACT this file encodes is binding and is shared verbatim with the engine's own
// ticket (JOS-466). Restated here because a supervisor that only half-remembers it is a supervisor
// that will one day accept half a handshake:
//
//   1. NO SECRETS IN ARGV OR ENV. The first line on the child's STDIN is the token (64 hex chars,
//      LF-terminated). argv is world-readable on Windows (any process can walk the process list
//      and read a command line); a pipe between two processes is not.
//   2. THE CHILD BINDS 127.0.0.1 PORT 0 and prints EXACTLY ONE line to stdout:
//      `EQC-ENGINE PORT=<port> PROTOCOL=<protocolVersion>`, then flushes. Nothing else ever goes
//      to stdout; diagnostics go to stderr. That is why the regex below is anchored and total: a
//      binary that prints anything else on stdout is not the engine we asked for, and treating it
//      as a failed spawn is the only safe reading. (Ephemeral port 0 rather than a fixed number
//      because a fixed port is a collision with whatever else on the machine picked it, and a
//      port we did not choose cannot be squatted by an impostor before we launch.)
//   3. EOF ON STDIN IS THE SHUTDOWN SIGNAL — the dies-with-app law (plan ruling 10). The engine
//      exits 0 promptly when its stdin closes. `child.kill` is the ESCALATION, not the norm.
//   4. EVERY TCP CONNECTION OPENS WITH A VALID `hello` OR IS CLOSED.
//   5. A RESPAWN IS A LAUNCH: fresh token, fresh epoch world, resume is always requery. Nothing in
//      this file ever carries state across a spawn except the FAILURE trail, which is about the
//      supervisor's own patience and not about the world.

//     own, because "the binary would not start" and "the engine stopped answering" are different

// --------------------------------------------- the engine that keeps dying AFTER it served

// THE FAILURE SHAPE THIS EXISTS TO MAKE VISIBLE (JOS-519), and it came from a real report: a
// 1.11.0 user said the log "keeps catching up even while in-game", and the engine diagnostic his
// report carried at the same moment said no engine answered. One hypothesis fits both facts — the
// engine reaches READY, folds, and dies minutes later (an EDR product, an OOM); the supervisor
// respawns it, and a respawn is a launch (contract rule 5), so every one of them re-folds the log
// from the beginning and the user watches another "Catching up on your log".
//
// IT WAS INVISIBLE, AND STRUCTURALLY SO. `supervisor.ts` resets the exit trail on every READY edge,
// which is exactly right for the loop above — that trail is about launches that never worked — and
// which means an engine that dies every ten minutes but always comes back never collapses a trail,
// never raises a fault, and mints no error-store entry at all. The store holds zero engine families
// today, and nobody can say whether that is because engines never die mid-session or because a
// mid-session death has never been reported. This is the instrument that answers it.
//
// THE SAME FOLD SHAPE AS `engineExitStep` ABOVE, on purpose: a trail in, a trail and an optional
// log out, so the supervisor holds one field and the policy stays a pure function this suite can
// drive. What differs is the QUESTION — that one asks "is this launch loop never going to work",
// this one asks "has a WORKING engine been replaced too often to be a coincidence" — and so the
// counter is SESSION-scoped and is never reset by a launch reaching READY. Reaching READY is what
// makes a death count here rather than what forgives it.

 * How many mid-session deaths make a pattern. THREE, for `ENGINE_QUICK_EXIT_STREAK`'s reasons a

// ------------------------------------------------------------------ where the binary lives
//
// TWO DEPLOYMENTS, AND THE RESOLUTION IS A PROBE RATHER THAN A GUESS — `sounds.ts bundledRoots()`
// is the precedent, and it is a probe for the same reason: the same source tree produces a dev run
// (cargo's `target/release/` beside the checkout), an e2e build, and a packaged app (unpacked beside
// the asar under `process.resourcesPath`), and which one is running is not a thing this module can
// know from its own path.
//
// PACKAGING HAS LANDED (JOS-473, phase 3) AND THIS FILE DID NOT HAVE TO MOVE: `electron-builder.yml`
// copies the RELEASE binary to `resources/engine/engined.exe` — the address the packaged candidate
// below already named while nothing shipped it. `tests/enginePackaging.test.mts` COMPOSES that
// destination out of the config and requires it to be exactly this candidate, so the two files
// cannot drift into a packaged app that resolves nothing and logs an absence.
//
// DEBUG-FIRST WAS THE DOCUMENTED INTENT AND IT WAS A TRAP (JOS-520). What stood here argued that a
// developer with a fresh `cargo build` means to run THAT binary, so `target/debug` was probed before
// `target/release`. The argument has one unstated premise — that a debug binary in the tree was PUT
// there on purpose by the person who is about to launch the app — and the premise is false. `cargo
// test` writes `target/debug/engined.exe` as a side effect of running the engine's own unit tests,
// which every worker in this program does; the owner's dev app then silently switched engines on its
// next restart. MEASURED on that switch: the spell DB built in 4050 ms instead of 469 ms, the parse
// ran about ten times slower, and catch-up took minutes on a log that folds in seconds. The only
// tell in the entire product was one dev-log line nobody was reading, and this file's own comment
// had predicted the whole thing.
//
// SO THE DEFAULT IS RELEASE, AND DEBUG IS AN OPT-IN THAT NEVER PERSISTS (the owner's ruling: *it
// should not do that unless we are opting into performance testing and then afterwards it should
// swap back*). `EngineBinaryEnv.profile` carries the opt-in as DATA — `engineHost.ts` reads
// `EQC_ENGINE_PROFILE` off the environment, this file never touches a `process` — and an absent
// opt-in means `target/debug` is not a candidate at all. Because the opt-in is per-LAUNCH and
// nothing writes it down, "afterwards it should swap back" needs no mechanism: the next launch
// without the variable is on the release engine again.
//
// AND WHENEVER A NON-RELEASE BINARY WINS, SOMETHING SAYS SO LOUDLY. `engineProfileNotice` below is
// the sentence and `engineHost.ts` is the one that emits it (`logWarn`, on every resolution). A
// slow engine is the failure mode this whole section exists to stop being a mystery, and an opt-in
// that selects a 10× slower binary in silence is the same trap wearing a different hat.
//
// AN ENGINE DEVELOPER LOSES NOTHING. `EQC_ENGINE_PROFILE=debug npm run dev` is one shell away, and
// the e2e harness's `override` (below) still outranks everything for whoever wants to name a file
// outright.
