// ============================================================================
//
// > "i want to see the server in the cpu/performance overlay in app."
//
// `shared/perf.ts` is the pure half of the HUD — the fold, the percentile, the formatters, all of
// it testable with no Electron and no window. This is the same half for the engine section, and it
// is a separate file for the reason `preload/perf.ts` is separate from `preload/index.ts`: that one
// is at the repo's factoring ceiling and the answer to that is a split.
//
// TWO SOURCES, ONE SHAPE, AND THE JOIN IS MAIN'S. The engine's row has two halves that no single
// reader could give:
//
//   * WHAT THE OS SEES — CPU and working set for the engine's pid. `app.getAppMetrics()` cannot
//     answer it (Chromium's own process list does not contain a child this app spawned), so
//     `main/processSample.ts` reads it directly.
//   * WHAT THE ENGINE SAYS — status, epoch, events, the mark, the ingest's bill and the serve
//     table. `perf.snapshot` (owner ruling 19), asked over the one door.
//
// Main joins them and pushes one object. The renderer never talks to the engine — brokering a
// client into a window is a separate ticket — so this arrives on the perf channels that already
// exist, exactly like every other number in that panel.
//
// EVERY FIELD THAT COULD BE UNKNOWN IS `null` RATHER THAN ZERO, and that is the same law
// `HealthResult`'s optional fields keep at the other end of the wire. A CPU percentage needs an
// interval behind it; a scan time does not exist until a scan finishes; a parity verdict that has
// not run has established nothing. Each of those is drawn as its own words, never as a zero that
// reads like a measurement.
