// The dev restart button's decision (JOS-61, rebuilt in JOS-63 — src/main/devRestart.ts).
//
// TWO THINGS ARE PINNED HERE and they fail in different directions:
//
//   1. THE PACKAGED GUARD. The channel is registered in EVERY build (src/main/ipc/dev.ts), so
//      the thing that keeps a shipped app safe is this predicate and nothing else.
//   2. WHICH RESTART. Under `npm run dev` an `exit(0)` ends the electron-vite WATCHER (its CLI
//      does `ps.on('close', process.exit)`) and takes the renderer's dev server with it, so the
//      relaunched successor loads a URL that no longer answers — the blank window JOS-63 exists
//      to kill. With a dev server present the decision must therefore TOUCH the watch anchor and
//      never relaunch; with no dev server it must still relaunch, because that path is correct
//      when the renderer comes off disk.
//
// It is a pure function over injected hosts precisely so both directions can be asserted:
// `relaunch()` + `exit(0)` against the real Electron `app` would end the test runner.
//
// No Electron, no fixtures, no network — the security.test.mts / storeMigrations.test.mts
// precedent, so this suite never skips. The one filesystem fact it does assert is that the watch
// anchor still names a real file in this repo (a moved anchor would silently downgrade every dev
// restart to a refusal).
