/**
 * THE ENGINE SECTION OF THE PERFORMANCE PANEL, in the running app (JOS-483, owner ruling 19).
 *
 * > "i want to see the server in the cpu/performance overlay in app." — owner.
 *
 * Its own module for `perfProfileSteps.mts`'s reason exactly: the spec it serves already owns a
 * full launch and a full fold, and a second subject inside one file makes each claim's evidence
 * depend on the other's setup. It is called from there rather than given a launch of its own
 * because THE ONLY EXPENSIVE THING IT NEEDS IS AN ENGINE THAT HAS FOLDED SOMETHING — which is
 * precisely the state that spec has just spent a whole scan reaching.
 *
 * ── ITS HOST SPEC, AND THE TWO YEARS THIS MODULE SPENT NOT RUNNING ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * It was written to be called from `engine-parity.e2e.mts`. THAT SPEC NO LONGER EXISTS — it went
 * with the parity probe when JOS-499 deleted the TypeScript fold — and nothing was wired up in its
 * place, so from that deletion until JOS-502 this module was dead code that no runner touched. It
 * had rotted, too, and in exactly the way dead test code does: it still demanded that the parity
 * row say `agree`, which had been unsatisfiable since the day there stopped being two folds to
 * compare. Both facts are the same lesson JOS-501 wrote down about `wireCrumbs` — when a thing's
 * failure mode is silence, what keeps it honest is somebody running it, not somebody reading it.
 *
 * IT IS CALLED FROM `engine-loot-view.e2e.mts` NOW, and that spec is the right host for the same
 * reason the old one was: it launches with `EQC_ENGINE=1`, folds a real fixture, and opens a real
 * subscription — so by the time these steps run, the engine has an ingest cost worth reporting AND
 * a serve table with a source in it, which is the only state in which this section is fully drawn.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS THE E2E AND NOT A UNIT TEST. Everything above the FFI boundary is already pinned by
 * `tests/enginePerf.test.mts` (the per-pid arithmetic over a fake pid, the formatters' absent cases,
 * the hook's arming and disarming run for real). What no unit can see is the WHOLE CHAIN: a real
 * engine process answering `perf.snapshot` over a real loopback socket, a real Win32 read of a real
 * pid, main joining the two, and the numbers coming out the other end of the preload bridge into a
 * DOM node. Four processes and two languages; only a launched app has all of them.
 *
 * IT DRIVES THE UI RATHER THAN THE CHANNEL. Reading `window.eq.onEnginePerf` directly would be a
 * shorter spec and a weaker one — it would prove the IPC and prove nothing about the section being
 * rendered, which is the entire deliverable. So the HUD is switched on the way a person switches it
 * on, the chip is clicked, and the assertion is against the text that appears.
 *
 * AND IT PRINTS WHAT IT SAW. The acceptance bar for this ticket is the panel's content reported
 * VERBATIM from a real run on a staged fixture, so the section's own `innerText` is echoed into the
 * run's notes — which also makes a future regression legible as a diff of what the panel says
 * rather than as a failed boolean.
 *
 * ── THE PROCESS ROW IS ASSERTED HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `EQ_E2E` is deliberately NOT a gate on the native per-pid read (`processSample.ts` argues why:
 * that module only reads, so `engineHost.ts`'s rule applies rather than `priorityIsSupported`'s),
 * which means this spec exercises the SAME code path a player does — koffi mapped into main, a
 * handle opened on the engine's pid, `GetProcessTimes` and `GetProcessMemoryInfo`. Those four Win32
 * calls are the one part of this feature no unit test can reach, and this is the only place in the
 * suite where they run against a real engine process.
 *
 * THE CPU FIGURE IS ALLOWED TO SAY "measuring". It is a RATE, so the first reading of a pid has no
 * interval behind it, and whether a second poll has landed before the assertion is a race with a
 * two-second cadence. The row is therefore asserted as "a pid and a working set, and a CPU field
 * that is either a percentage or the honest placeholder" — which is a claim about the reading
 * having happened, and does not turn a timing accident into a red run.
