// ============================================================================
// feedbackPerfEngine.test.mts — THE ENGINE'S NUMBERS ON A BUG REPORT (ruling 19, JOS-502).
// ============================================================================
//
// Four things are proved here and they are the four the block can get wrong:
//
//   1. THE BRIGHT LINE, held by SHAPE. The engine's `perf.snapshot` carries an absolute path to the
//      user's game log and the log's own clock. Neither can reach a report, and the test that says
//      so serializes the whole folded block and searches it — not the fields it remembered to
//      check, the BYTES. That is the only form of this assertion that survives somebody adding a
//      field later.
//   2. ABSENT, NEVER ZERO. A scan still running, a session whose every frame was an owed reset, an
//      engine that has not sampled its ring — each of those has no measurement, and a zero would be
//      a measurement somebody took.
//   3. THE CLOSED SETS ARE CLOSED at both ends. An engine ahead of the app cannot open a string
//      channel through `id`, `verdict` or `state`: the fold drops what it does not recognise and
//      the validator refuses it.
//   4. THE CEILINGS AGREE with the ones `feedbackPerf.ts` states, which is the pin that keeps a
//      by-value restatement honest — the same pin `feedbackPerfSeams.test.mts` carries.
