///     speak; otherwise "no wear-off printed" is a fact about the spell's messages, not its
///     duration.
///  3. ONE landing only. A corpse names a mob but never which mob of that name, so with two
///     landings the log does not say which died — and a wear-off may already have closed the other.
///  4. It must BEAT the current estimate. A bound below what the app already draws is useless.
///  5. The same-name cap: for an article-named mob the span may not exceed twice the current
///     estimate, because a same-named mob dying long after the landing is more likely a different
///     one. A proper name has no twin and takes no such cap.
///  6. The absolute cap: no bound may exceed three times what the spell database states. With no
///     database row there is nothing to multiply and the bound is refused outright.
///
/// An offline gap refuses it too: the wear-off sentence only exists while you are logged in, so
/// across an absence "no wear-off printed" stops being a claim about the world at all.
