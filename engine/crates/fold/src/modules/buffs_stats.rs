//! The one observed-duration learner, and the per-line game knowledge beside it: the mined duration
//! samples, the recency map, and the spell catalog.
//!
//! This is GAME knowledge, not character state — a spell's duration and its cast messages are
//! identical across a rebirth — so the module's rebirth and session-gap clears leave it intact.
//!
//! Keyed on (LINE, CASTER):
//!
//!   * the LINE is rank-stripped, so `Mesmerization III` and `Mesmerization VII` pool. Not per-rank:
//!     the committed spells.json has zero rows at rank VI or above, so a per-rank key would start
//!     every upgrade back at the DB floor and re-learn from nothing on every level.
//!   * the CASTER is 'self' or an allowlisted external. A duration is a fact about a caster's AAs,
//!     focus items and rank, so pooling a grouped enchanter's mez with your own gives a bar wrong
//!     for both.
//!
//! The estimator is `max(DB baseline, max over the recent window of observed samples)`. The DB base
//! is a FLOOR and the observed max is an EXTENSION over it, because a beneficial buff's true
//! duration is never below its base — AA and focus only extend — so a below-base observation is an
//! early termination and the max discards it.
//!
//! The baseline is RANK-SCALED: an upgrade tier grows a spell's duration by a per-category
//! percentage, so the floor is the DB base grown by the highest tier a cast line has named for this
//! (line, caster) — see `buffs_shapes::scaled_floor_ms`. Only that number changes; every rule the
//! learner applies to it is untouched.
//!
//! The floor can lose exactly one way. Its assumption is a claim about the game the wiki describes,
//! and this server re-tiered spells the scrape still describes the old way, so a below-floor
//! observation may overrule it when the log CORROBORATES it (see [`corroborated_max`]). The source
//! then reads `Cluster` rather than `Observed`, because the two make opposite claims about the row.
//!
//! A third kind of evidence covers the case where no cycle can ever be witnessed: a debuffed mob's
//! DEATH with no wear-off since the landing is a LOWER BOUND. On raid mobs that is all the evidence
//! there is. A bound folds into the max like any other sample and reports `DeathBound` when it wins,
//! and it is refused the cluster rule and the n/median columns, because it is not a CYCLE.
//!
//! And it is SUBORDINATE to what the log has actually watched end: where the window holds any clean
//! fade, a bound contributes at most the longest of them — a death corroborates the ceiling fades
//! have proven, never raises it. Where the window holds none, a bound is the only evidence there is
//! and keeps its full reach up to its own rails.
//!
//! The window is applied ONCE PER EVIDENCE CLASS: the most recent five uncensored samples are one
//! window and the most recent five lower bounds are a second, with the observed candidate the max
//! over both. So a censored sample can never push an uncensored one out of view, or vice versa —
//! without which a run of early breaks drives the estimate under the true duration, the shorter
//! unwitnessed grace then culls every full-length hold, and the number is frozen below the truth
//! permanently. A real decrease still recovers, in five uncensored shorter cycles.
