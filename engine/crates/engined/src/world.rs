//! The one door: every piece of state this process holds lives behind [`World`], and every reader —
//! including the engine's own — asks by calling a method. There is no `pub` field and no way to
//! borrow the state, so a cache under this seam would stay invisible to callers. Nothing is cached
//! now and nothing may be.
//!
//! State is addressed by (log identity, byte offset), never "current": the epoch is stated on every
//! answer that depends on it, and progress is [`World::mark`]. No world state may be a function of
//! the wall clock — the two clock-shaped reads here, `uptimeMs` and `logMtimeMs`, are properties of
//! the process and of a file. A new generation is a new world and the only way between them is the
//! fresh reset; there is no incremental repair.
//!
//! The epoch bump and its announcement are one critical section, so no connection can hear about
//! generation N+1 before N; opening a subscription and stamping its reset share that section for
//! the same reason. The generation doubles as the ingest's ownership token: bumped under this lock,
//! readable without it (an in-flight fold asks "do I still own the world?" at every slice
//! boundary), and re-checked inside the lock by every `report_*`, so a loser can write nothing,
//! ever.
