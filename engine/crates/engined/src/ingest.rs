//! One thread per attach: open the log, scan it at full speed, then tail it live, handing every
//! event to one [`EventSink`]. `eqlog` owns what an event is; this module owns who is folding, when
//! it stops, and what it says about itself.
//!
//! An attach preempts any in-flight attach — last pick wins, losers are dropped rather than queued
//! and return silently at their next slice boundary. Each attach builds its own sink and its own
//! parser, so two folds can never reach one set of modules.
//!
//! Nothing event-derived reads a wall clock. Exactly two wall-clock reads reach a sink:
//! [`SinkInputs::attached_at_ms`], once per attach, and [`EventSink::tick`], ~1×/sec and live only.
//! The historical scan never ticks — the tick loop lives past the `TailStart::At` handoff, which is
//! what keeps a replay a pure function of its bytes.
