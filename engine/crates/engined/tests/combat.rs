//! The combat surface over a real socket off a real fold: the ops `combat.snapshot` and
//! `combat.searchFights`, and the view source `combat.live`.
//!
//! The log is written here and stamped with this machine's clock, unlike every other suite in this
//! crate. Two claims below turn on the difference between a replay's instant and a live world's, and
//! a fight dated in a committed fixture would produce a meter whose every rate had been divided by
//! its staleness. The weekday in an EQ stamp is not parsed, so `Wed` is written and means nothing.
//!
//! One claim uses a committed fixture instead: catching an answer mid-fold needs a log big enough
//! that the scan is still running when the question is asked.
//!
//! What no unit test can claim: the answers came off the fold on the ingest thread through the one
//! door, `now` is chosen by the world's own state rather than by the caller, and a live window over
//! a source whose rows edit produces `update` ops carrying changed cells only.
