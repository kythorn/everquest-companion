//! The EverQuest Legends log parser: bytes in, canonical events out.
//!
//! Two ways in and one line law between them: `scan.rs` folds a complete file, `tail.rs` follows one
//! EverQuest is still appending to, and the tail's line sequence must equal the scan's over any
//! chunking at all.
//!
//! The bar is byte identity with the TypeScript parser's NDJSON event stream, not equivalence. That
//! is why several things here look stranger than a merely correct parser would:
//!
//!   * events are written key by key rather than derived (`event.rs`), because `JSON.stringify`
//!     writes insertion order and the insertion order is a property of the code path;
//!   * `\d`, `\w`, `\s`, `.trim()` and `JSON.stringify`'s escape set are spelled out (`jsstr.rs`),
//!     because JavaScript's are ASCII-or-ECMA where Rust's are Unicode;
//!   * timestamps resolve through an IANA zone with historical DST (`timestamp.rs`), because the TS
//!     hands a zone-less string to `Date.parse` and gets host local time;
//!   * the whole spell-DB load path is reproduced (`spelldb/`), because the `candidates` list a
//!     `buffApply` carries is that database.
//!
//! A parse produces two things at once: the NDJSON line, and a typed `Payload` recording the kind as
//! a discriminant with each field as a `(Key, Slot)` pair in write order, strings in one reused
//! arena. The fold reads the payload; re-parsing the line into a `serde_json::Value` cost 9.6% of a
//! whole fold. Both halves are handed over together because the writer's buffers are reused — a
//! caller that took one could not ask for the other afterwards.
//!
//! A parse is a pure function of (bytes, spell-DB version, character name). Everything stateful
//! lives on `Parser` and nothing outlives it.
